								<h2 style="text-align:center;">Nanaimo Bary</h2>
								<p style="font-size: 20px;">“The first printing of recipes featuring Nanaimo bar ingredients is found in the 1952 Women's Auxiliary to the Nanaimo Hospital Cookbook, which features three nearly identical recipes that differ only slightly from the modern Nanaimo bar. They are referred to as the "chocolate square" or the "chocolate slice".
History moves to firmer ground when Vancouver caterer, chef, and Lazy Gourmet cookbook writer Susan Mendelson is credited with raising the bar to cult status and expanding its potential to include mocha and other versions. Mint flavouring created a fresh variant. Other riffs on the original led to blondies topped with white chocolate.
Other unconfirmed references date the bar back to the 1930s, when it was said to be known locally as "chocolate fridge cake". One modern reference even refers to the bars' existing in nineteenth century Nanaimo.” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanaimo_bar#cite_note-LLN-1">See more.</a></p>

								<h2 style="text-align:center;">Ice cream sandwich</h2>
								<p style="font-size: 20px;">The origin of this recipe is unknown, but it is popular in several countries such as Vietnam, Singapore, Iran and Australia.
There are many variations of the ice cream sandwich which include for example bread or cake in place of biscuit, and carry in its composition such produce as rose water.</p>
								<h3 style="padding: 2%;">Ingredients:</h3>
								<ul>
									<p>½ cup (113 grams) unsalted butter, melted;</p>
									<p>½ cup (100 grams) white granulated sugar;</p>
									<p>1 large egg;</p>
									<p>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract;</p>
									<p>½ cup (65 grams) all purpose flour;</p>
									<p>¼ cup (25 grams) unsweetened cocoa powder;</p>
									<p>¼ teaspoon salt;</p>
									<p>4 cups (2 pints) (950 ml) Ice Cream (Homemade or Store Bought), slightly softened - see what happens in step 6 if you let it get too melty!!</p>
									<p>10 x 15 inch (25 x 38 cm) rimmed baking sheet;</p>
									<p>Parchment paper.</p>
								</ul>
								<h3 style="padding: 2%;">Directions:</h3>
								<ul>
									<p>1) Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) and place rack in center of oven.</p>
									<p>2) Chop up your butter and microwave it for 30 seconds to a minute.  Alternatively, melt it over low heat on the stove. Stir stir stir, to make sure all of the butter is melted, but not boiling.</p>
									<p>3) In a large bowl, whisk together the melted butter and sugar, whisk this in the egg and vanilla extract.</p>
									<p>4) Add the flour, cocoa powder, and salt and stir until combined and smooth, spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan.</p>
									<p>5) Bake for about 10 minutes turning the pan around halfway through cooking, so one side doesn't get more brown than the other. The cake is done when it is dry to the touch and the edges just begin to pull away from the sides of the pan. Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool.</p>
									<p>6) Gently lift the cake onto a cutting board, with a serrated knife, cut the cake in half crosswise.</p>
									<p>7) Place one half of the cake, top side down, on a large piece of plastic wrap and spread with the slightly softened ice cream, smoothing with a spatula.</p>
									<p>8) Top with the remaining half of cake, top side up wrap tightly in plastic wrap and place in the freezer until firm, about two hours or overnight.</p>
									<p>9) When the sandwiches have set up, remove the freezer, unwrap, and with a serrated knife, cut into rectangles or squares.  Or get a cookie cutter and cut them into fun shapes!  The excess will need to be devoured immediately, and no one needs to know of it.</p>
								</ul>
								<p>If you don't eat them all at once, they can be wrapped in plastic individually and be stored in the freezer for up to one week.</p>

								<h2 style="text-align:center;">Banoffe	</h2>
								<p style="font-size: 20px;">“Banoffee pie or "bananoffe" is an English dessert pie made from bananas, cream and toffee (made from boiled condensed milk, or dulce de leche), combined either on a pastry base or one made from crumbled biscuits and butter. Some versions of the recipe also include chocolate, coffee or both.
Its name, sometimes spelled "banoffi", is a portmanteau combining the words "banana" and "toffee".
[...]
Credit for the pie's invention is claimed by Nigel Mackenzie and Ian Dowding, the owner and chef, respectively, of The Hungry Monk Restaurant in Jevington, East Sussex. They claim to have developed the dessert in 1971 by amending an unreliable American recipe for "Blum’s Coffee Toffee Pie" with a soft toffee made by boiling an unopened can of condensed milk for several hours. After trying various changes including the addition of apple or mandarin orange, Mackenzie suggested banana and Dowding later said that "straight away we knew we had got it right". Mackenzie suggested the name "Banoffi Pie", and the dish proved so popular with their customers that they "couldn't take it off" the menu.” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banoffee_pie"> See more</a></p>
								<h3 style="padding: 2%;">Ingredients:</h3>
								<ul>
									<p style="font-weight: bold;">For the base:</p>
									<p>100g butter, melted;</p>
									<p>250g digestive biscuits, crushed;</p>
									<p>20cm loose-bottomed cake tin, greased.</p>
									<p style="font-weight: bold;">For the caramel:</p>
									<p>100g butter;</p>
									<p>100g dark brown soft sugar;</p>
									<p>397g Condensed Milk.</p>
									<p style="font-weight: bold;">For the top:</p>
									<p>4 small bananas;</p>
									<p>300ml carton whipping cream, lightly whipped grated chocolate.</p>
								</ul>
								<h3 style="padding: 2%;">Directions:</h3>
								<ul>
									<p>1) Put the biscuit crumbs in your bowl, then tip in the melted butter and mix it all together. Spoon this into the base and press against the bottom and sides – this is the base of the banoffee pie recipe. Chill it for ten minutes.</p>
									<p>2) Melt the butter and sugar into a non-stick saucepan over a low heat, stirring all the time until the sugar has dissolved. Add the condensed milk and bring to a rapid boil for about a minute, stirring all the time for a thick golden caramel. Spread the caramel over the base, cool and then chill for about 1 hour, until firm or until ready to serve.</p>
									<p>3) Carefully lift the pie from the tin and place on a serving plate. Slice the bananas; fold half of them into the softly whipped cream and spoon over the base. Decorate with the remaining bananas and finish with the grated chocolate.</p>

								<h2 style="text-align:center;">Pumpkin pie</h2>
								<p style="font-size: 20px;">“The pumpkin is native to the continent of North America. The pumpkin was an early export to France; from there it was introduced to Tudor England, and the flesh of the "pompion" was quickly accepted as pie filler. During the seventeenth century, pumpkin pie recipes could be found in English cookbooks, such as Hannah Woolley's The Gentlewoman's Companion (1675). Pumpkin "pies" made by early American colonists were more likely to be a savory soup made and served in a pumpkin than a sweet custard in a crust.
It was not until the early nineteenth century that the recipes appeared in American cookbooks or pumpkin pie became a common addition to the Thanksgiving dinner.The Pilgrims brought the pumpkin pie back to New England,] while the English method of cooking the pumpkin took a different course. In the 19th century, the English pumpkin pie was prepared by stuffing the pumpkin with apples, spices, and sugar and then baking it whole.[8][9]
Today, throughout much of the United States, it is traditional to serve pumpkin pie after Thanksgiving dinner. Additionally, many modern companies produce seasonal pumpkin pie-flavored products such as candy, cheesecake, coffee, ice cream, french toast, waffles and pancakes, and many breweries produce a seasonal pumpkin ale or beer; these are generally not flavored with pumpkins, but rather pumpkin pie spices. Commercially made pumpkin pie mix is made from Cucurbita pepo, Cucurbita maxima, and Cucurbita moschata (Libbey Select uses the Select Dickinson Pumpkin variety of C. moschata for its canned pumpkins).”  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumpkin_pie">See more.</a></p>

								<h2 style="text-align:center;">Flapjack</h2>
								<p style="font-size: 20px;">“The Oxford English Dictionary records the word "flapjack" as being used as early as the beginning of the 16th century, although at this time it seems to have been a flat tart Shakespeare refers to "flap-jacks" in Pericles, Prince of Tyre, but this is one of the many anachronisms in his historical plays and does not suggest that he thought it was a middle eastern dish, merely a common English dessert of the time:
"Come, thou shant go home, and we'll have flesh for holidays, fish for fasting-days, and moreo'er puddings and flap-jacks, and thou shalt be welcome." Act II Scene I
Later, flapjack would be used to describe something similar to an apple flan, but it is not until 1935 that the word is first used to describe a food made of oats. While in the UK this usage has mostly superseded earlier recipes, in North America, "flapjack" still refers to pancakes.”  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flapjack_(oat_bar)">See more.</a></p>

								</ul>
								<h3 style="padding: 2%;">Directions:</h3>
								<ul>
									<p>1) Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2 and line a 20cm/8in square baking tin with baking paper.</p>
									<p>2) Melt the butter in a medium pan over a low heat. Dip a brush in the butter and brush the baking tin with a little bit of it. Add the golden syrup and sugar to the butter and heat gently. Once the sugar is dissolved and the butter is melted, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the porridge oats, lemon zest and ginger.</p>
									<p>3) Pack the mixture into the baking tin and squash down. Bake in the oven for 40 minutes.</p>
									<p>4) Once cooked, remove from the oven, leave to cool for 15 minutes, then turn out on to a chopping board and cut into squares.</p>
									<p>5) These flapjacks are delicious in a packed lunch or as a grab-and-go breakfast.</p>

								<h3 style="padding: 2%;">Ingredients:</h3>
								<ul>
									<p>1 ½ cups (355 ml) lemon juice (about 10 medium lemons);</p>
									<p>4 ½ cups (1065 ml) water;</p>
									<p>2 cups (480 ml) of cranberry juice, pomegranate juice or more water;</p>
									<p>1 cup (240 ml) white sugar;</p>
									<p>¾ cup (180 ml) of raspberries or strawberries (fresh or frozen).</p>
									<p style="font-weight: bold;">Optional:</p>
									<p>Ice;</p>
									<p>Leaves of basil or mint;</p>
									<p>Red food coloring.</p>
								</ul>
								<h3 style="padding: 2%;">Directions:</h3>
								<ul>
									<p>Mix the sugar and water. Add one cup (240 ml) of white sugar to four and a half cups (1125 ml) of water and stir until dissolved. If you are using crystal sugar instead of refined sugar, it may be necessary to slightly heat the mixture on the stove to help dissolve it. If you prefer a sour lemonade, use as an alternative ⅔ cup (160 ml) sugar.
</br></br>
Mix the liquid ingredients. In a jar with a capacity of two and a half liters or more, add the water and sugar mixture, one cup and a half (375 ml) of lemon juice, two cups (500 ml) of cranberry juice or other red fruit juice and stir. If you prefer sweet lemonade, alternatively use a cup (240 ml) of lemon juice. If you do not have red fruit juice available, replace it with water. The fruit itself will only add a little color, so add a few drops of red food coloring.
</br></br>
Add the fruit. Strawberries can be cut into thin slices or larger pieces and placed directly into the jar. If you choose the raspberries, knead them first in a separate bowl to extract the juice and then strain the liquid over the lemonade using a piece of morim, muslin, or a fine mesh sieve.
You can skip this step if you have added red fruit juice, but the fruit itself will add extra flavor and a fresh look.Let the frozen fruit thaw first for a few minutes.Raspberries add much more color than strawberries. In addition, frozen raspberries provide greater coloration than fresh raspberries, as ice crystals cause a break in the fruit.

								<p style="font-size: 20px;">Sassafras root beverages were made by indigenous peoples of the Americas for culinary and medicinal reasons before the arrival of Europeans in North America, and European culinary techniques have been applied to making traditional sassafras-based beverages similar to root beer since the 16th century. Root beer was sold in confectionery stores since the 1840s, and written recipes for root beer have been documented since the 1860s. It possibly was combined with soda as early as the 1850s, and root beer sold in stores was most often sold as a syrup rather than a ready-made beverage. The tradition of brewing root beer is thought to have evolved out of other small beer traditions that produced fermented drinks with very low alcohol content that were thought to be healthier to drink than possibly tainted local sources of drinking water, and enhanced by the medicinal and nutritional qualities of the ingredients used. Beyond its aromatic qualities, the medicinal benefits of sassafras were well known to both Native Americans and Europeans, and druggists began marketing root beer for its medicinal qualities.
Pharmacist Charles Elmer Hires was the first to successfully market a commercial brand of root beer. Hires developed his root tea made from sassafras in 1875, debuted a commercial version of root beer at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876, and began selling his extract. Hires was a teetotaler who wanted to call the beverage "root tea". However, his desire to market the product to Pennsylvania coal miners caused him to call his product "root beer", instead.In 1886, Hires began to bottle a beverage made from his famous extract. By 1893, root beer was distributed widely across the United States. Non-alcoholic versions of root beer became commercially successful, especially during Prohibition.
Not all traditional or commercial root beers were sassafras-based. One of Hires's early competitors was Barq's, which began selling its sarsaparilla-based root beer in 1898 and was labeled simply as "Barq's". In 1919, Roy Allen opened his root-beer stand in Lodi, California, which led to the development of A&W Root Beer. One of Allen's innovations was that he served his homemade root beer in cold, frosty mugs. IBC Root Beer is another brand of commercially produced root beer that emerged during this period and is still well-known today.
Safrole, the aromatic oil found in sassafras roots and bark that gave traditional root beer its distinctive flavour, was banned for commercially mass-produced foods and drugs by the FDA in 1960. Laboratory animals that were given oral doses of sassafras tea or sassafras oil that contained large doses of safrole developed permanent liver damage or various types of cancer. While sassafras is no longer used in commercially produced root beer and is sometimes substituted with artificial flavors, natural extracts with the safrole distilled and removed are available.

								<h3 style="padding: 2%;">Ingredients:</h3>
								<ul>
									<p>3 liters of water;</p>
									<p>1 vanilla bean;</p>
									<p>1 licorice root (10 cm) (broken into pieces);</p>
									<p>¾ cup. of dried sarsaparrilla root chopped;</p>
									<p>1 tbsp (tablespoon)  of dry bark of sassafras root;</p>
									<p>1tbsp (tablespoon)  of chopped dry burdock;</p>
									<p>1 cinnamon stick 7 cm;</p>
									<p>3 star anise stars;</p>
									<p>2 xíc. of brown sugar or grated sugar cane;</p>
									<p>1 of cane syrup;</p>
									<p>2 strips of orange peel;</p>
									<p>1/8 colh. (tea) yeast or champagne yeast.</p>
								</ul>
								<h3 style="padding: 2%;">Directions:</h3>
								<p>In a saucepan, place the split vanilla bean in the middle of long + licorice + sarsaparrilla + sassafras + burdock + cinnamon + star anise + 2 liters of water and boil over high heat.
Decrease the heat, stir and cook uncovered for 15 minutes.
Add the brown sugar + molasses + orange peel and cook for another 10 minutes, stirring until the sugar dissolves well.
Remove from heat and rest for 30 minutes.
In a jar or large container, put the rest of the water and pour over the contents of the pot very well strained.
I cover the container and cool well (it will take time) until it is warm (as if it were to dissolve baking soda without killing yeast).
When the liquid is warm, shake well.
Dissolve beer yeast in 1/4 cup. of lukewarm water and let stand for 5 minutes.
Put inside the container with the "juice" and shake well.
Put in bottles (can be pet bottle) and close well and leave in a warm place, away from the sun, to ferment for 2 ~ 3 days (depending on the temperature).
Tighten the bottle if it is hard because it is ready.
Put in the refrigerator to stop fermenting and not to blow the bottle.
Open it with care the first time because it may leak a little with gas.</p>

									<p>5) Add the milk and whisk to remove any lumps and add the salt and pepper.</p>
